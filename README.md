# PLEX DOCTOR
- Checks if plex is alive and well if not -> Restart
- MORE ON THE WAY

## Requirements 
- Plex 3.8 or above


## Plans to add
- Notifications - Email, Discord, Slack
- Read from logs what went wrong with plex and notify user
- Scheduling so we can run it as a service
- Check for more things that could be going wrong. Possible to test a short video transcode/direct stream?
